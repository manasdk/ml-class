Hello Dear,

Compliments of the day. I came across your contact address while searching
for someone to  help me, I lost my parents and want you to stand as my
foreign trustee to retrive and  invest USD$6.5 Million which I inherited
from my late parent. I tried to get this money out  from the bank , but the
management refused because of my age. I am ready to give you 25% of  the
whole money at the completion of the transaction, write me back for more
details.

Regards, Miss.Mary Anderson.
